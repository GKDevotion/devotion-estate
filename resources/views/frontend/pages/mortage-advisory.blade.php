                        A real estate mortgage is a legal agreement where a borrower (typically a property owner) pledges
                        real
                        property to a lender as security for a loan. This arrangement allows the borrower to receive funds
                        upfront,
                        usually to purchase or refinance real estate, while the lender obtains the right to take possession
                        of the
                        property if the borrower fails to repay the loan according to the agreed terms.
